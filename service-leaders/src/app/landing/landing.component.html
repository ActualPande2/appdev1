    <h1>Welcome to the Johto Region</h1>
    <p>
      The Johto Region is a land rich with tradition and history, home to ancient
      towers, myths of the legendary Pokémon Lugia and Ho-Oh, and a strong bond
      between people and Pokémon. Trainers travel across Johto to challenge the
      eight Gym Leaders and earn their badges on the path to the Pokémon League.
